### Parts
These are the parts iv'e used in this project

1. arduino nano / nodemcu
2. solenoid valve 
3. old charger which gives 5V DC and at least 1 amp current. or 7805 voltage regulator which can take input from 12 V adapter
4. 12 V adapter to trigger the solenoid valve.
5. Relay
6. pipe spanning across all the flower pots.

All the circuitry can fit in a tiny box as shared in the image.

Code basically contains two delays.

1. For the interval at which it should start. 
2. Another for the duration for which the valve should remain open.
